It is famous mostly for its long natural sandy beach, and it is infamous for the largest refugee camp in the world. It is located 150 km (93 mi) south of the divisional headquarter city of Chittagong. Cox's Bazar is also known by the name Panowa, which translates literally as "yellow flower". Another old name was "Palongkee".

        The modern Cox's Bazar derives its name from Captain Hiram Cox, an officer of the British East India Company, a Superintendent of Palongkee outpost. To commemorate his role in refugee rehabilitation work, a market was established and named after him.
        
        The municipality covers an area of 6.85 km2 (2.64 sq mi) with 27 mahallas and 9 wards and as of 2012 had a population of 51,918.[2] Cox's Bazar is connected by road and air with Chittagong.[3][4]`,
